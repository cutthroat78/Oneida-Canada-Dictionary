# Oneida (Canada) Wordlist
[Github Pages](https://cutthroat78.github.io/Oneida-Canada-Wordlist)

A CSV and markdown Oneida (Canada) wordlist from using the All Category on this webpage https://oneidalanguage.ca/learn-our-language/oneidalanguage-words-phrases/ 

CSV is just all of the wordlist, while markdown has all and categories

main.py is the python program I used to generate the csv file. Change the file variable in the file to change the output file name and change the URL for the page/category for it to scrape

The audio folder is full of mp3 recordings of the Oneida words and phrases/side in the csv and markdown wordlist. To find the recording of a Oneida word/phrase, just look for a file with the same ID as the Oneida word/phrase

# To Do
