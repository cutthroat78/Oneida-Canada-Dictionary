# Oneida (Canada) Words and Phrases
[Github Pages](https://cutthroat78.github.io/Oneida-Canada-Words-and-Phrases/)

A CSV Oneida (Canada) file with words and Phrases from using the All Category on this webpage https://oneidalanguage.ca/learn-our-language/oneidalanguage-words-phrases/ 

main.py is the python program I used to generate the csv file

The audio folder is full of mp3 recordings of the Oneida words and phrases/side of the csv file. To find the recording of a Oneida word/phrase, just like for a file with the same names at the Oneida word/phrase as it is in the csv file

# To Do
- [ ] CSV file is full words and phrases, markdown will have full and sections versions
- [ ] Redo readme.md and index.md with all info explaining this whole repo (including how to use main.py)
- [ ] Move All words and phrases to seperate page from index.md
- [ ] Remove double quotes around markdown strings in Oneida and English Section
