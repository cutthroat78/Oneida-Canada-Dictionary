# CSV File of Oneida (Canada) Words and Phrases
[Github Pages](https://cutthroat78.github.io/Oneida-Canada-Words-and-Phrases/)

A CSV Oneida (Canada) file with words and Phrases from using the All Category on this webpage https://oneidalanguage.ca/learn-our-language/oneidalanguage-words-phrases/ 

main.py is the python program I used to generate the csv file

The audio folder is full of mp3 recordings of the Oneida words and phrases/side of the csv file. To find the recording of a Oneida word/phrase, just like for a file with the same names at the Oneida word/phrase as it is in the csv file

# To Do
- [ ] Redo CSV file but have quotes around both sides
- [ ] Redo CSV file but have a column that links to mp3 file
- [ ] Setup github pages with index.md
- [ ] Convert CSV to markdown table
- [ ] Try and get github pages to play mp3 files. If files need to have no spaces, make program replace spaces with "-"
- [ ] CSV file is full words and phrases, markdown will have full and sections versions
- [ ] Redo readme.md and index.md with all info explaining this whole repo (including how to use main.py)
